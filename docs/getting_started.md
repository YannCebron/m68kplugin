## Installation

Latest GA release: Open [Plugin Homepage](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17712-motorola-68000-series-assembler/) and click *Install to...* button on upper right.

Snapshot release: `m68kplugin-x.y.z.zip` artifacts for [manual installation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/plugins-settings.html) are available via [GitHub CI](https://github.com/YannCebron/m68kplugin/actions/workflows/build.yml).

## Project Setup

There is no dedicated support for configuring or creating a specific variant for M68k projects.

All sources and include files must be located in the same project to be resolved.

By default, all files with extension `.s`, `.asm`, `.i`, and `.x68` are treated as M68k assembly sources. See *Motorola 68000 Assembler* entry in *Settings/Preferences \| Editor \| File Types* to customize.

## Building

[vasm](http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vasm/) executable can easily be invoked via [External Tools](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-third-party-tools.html) and mapped to a keyboard shortcut for convenience.
Warning/error messages in the console provide navigation links to the _file:lineNumber_ or _label name_ source (see [IDE](features/ide.md)).                  

Alternatively, any supported build system can be used, e.g., [Makefile](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9333-makefile-language).
