## Project Setup

Currently, there is no dedicated support for configuring or creating a specific variant for M68k projects.

All sources and include files must be located in the same project to be resolved.

By default, all files with extension `.s`, `.asm`, `.i`, and `.x68` are treated as *. See *Motorola 68000 Assembler* in *Settings/Preferences \| Editor \| File Types* to customize.
