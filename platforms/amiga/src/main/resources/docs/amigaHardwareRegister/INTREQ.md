This register contains interrupt request bits (or flags).
These bits may be polled by the processor, and if enabled
by the bits listed in the next register, they may cause
processor interrupts. Both a set and clear operation
are required to load arbitrary data into this register.
The bit assignments are identical to the enable register
below.
