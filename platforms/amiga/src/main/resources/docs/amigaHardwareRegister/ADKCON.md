| 15    | SET/CLEAR   | Set/clear control bit. Determines if bits |
|       |             | written with a 1 get set or cleared. Bits |
|       |             | written with a zero are always unchanged. |
|       |             |                                           |
| 14-13 | PRECOMP 1-0 | 00=none, 01=140 ns, 10=280 ns, 11=560 ns  |
|       |             |                                           |
| 12    | MFMPREC     | 1 = MFM precomp / 0 = GCR precomp         |
| 11    | UARTBRK     | Forces a UART break (clears TXD) if true  |
| 10    | WORDSYNC    | Enables disk read synchronizing on a word |
|       |             | equal to DISK SYNC CODE, Located in       |
|       |             | address [DSKSYNC](DSKSYNC.md) (7E).   |
| 09    | MSBSYNC     | Enables disk read synchronizing on the    |
|       |             | MSB (most signif bit) appl type GCR       |
| 08    | FAST        | Disk data clock rate control 1=fast (2us) |
|       |             | 0=slow (4us)                              |
|       |             | (Fast for MFM or 2us, slow for 4us GCR)   |
| 07    | USE3PN      | Use audio channel 3 to modulate nothing   |
| 06    | USE2P3      | Use audio channel 2 to modulate period    |
|       |             | of channel 3                              |
| 05    | USE1P2      | Use audio channel 1 to modulate period    |
|       |             | of channel 2                              |
| 04    | USE0P1      | Use audio channel 0 to modulate period    |
|       |             | of channel 1                              |
| 03    | USE3VN      | Use audio channel 3 to modulate nothing   |
|       |             |                                           |
| 02    | USE2V3      | Use audio channel 2 to modulate volume    |
|       |             | of channel 3                              |
| 01    | USE1V2      | Use audio channel 1 to modulate volume    |
|       |             | of channel 2                              |
| 00    | USE0V1      | Use audio channel 0 to modulate volume    |
|       |             | of channel 1                              |


  > Note: If both period and volume are modulated on the same channel,
the period and volume will be alternated. First [AUDxDAT](AUDxDAT.md) word
is used for V6-V0 of [AUDxVOL](AUDxVOL.md). Second [AUDxDAT](AUDxDAT.md) word is used for
P15-P0 of [AUDxPER](AUDxPER.md). This alternating sequence is repeated.
