This address writes data to a transmit data buffer.
Data from this buffer is moved into a serial shift register
for output transmission whenever it is empty. This sets the
interrupt request TBE (transmit buffer empty). A stop bit
must be provided as part of the data word. The length
of the data word is set by the position of the stop bit.
