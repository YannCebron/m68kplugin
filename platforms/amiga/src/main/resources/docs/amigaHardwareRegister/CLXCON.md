This register controls which bitplanes are included (enabled) in
collision detection, and their required state if included. It also
controls the individual inclusion of odd numbered sprites in the
collision detection, by logically ORing them with their corresponding
even numbered sprite. Writing to this register resets the bits
in **CLXCON2**.
