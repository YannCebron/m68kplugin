This register is the disk-DMA data buffer. It contains 2
bytes of data that are either sent to (write) or received
from (read) the disk. The DMA controller automatically
transfers data to or from this register and RAM, and when
the DMA data is finished (length=0) it causes a disk
block interrupt. See interrupts below.
