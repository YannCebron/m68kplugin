This reg is the audio channel x (x=0,1,2,3) DMA
data buffer. It contains 2 bytes of data (each
byte is a twos complement signed integer) that
are outputted sequentially (with digital to analog
conversion) to the audio output pins. With maximum
volume, each byte can drive the audio outputs
with 0.8 volts (peak to peak,typ). The audio DMA
channel controller automatically transfers data
to this reg from RAM. The processor can also
write directly to this reg. When the DMA data is
finished (words outputted=length) and the data in
this reg has been used, an audio channel interrupt
request is set.
