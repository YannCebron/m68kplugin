|---|---|---|
| 15   | X        | Don't care - but drive to 0 for upward compatibility!  |
|      |          |                                                        |
| 14   | ZDBPSEL2 | 3 bit field which selects which bitplane is to be used |
| 13   | ZDBPSEL1 | for ZD when ZDBBPEN is set - 000 selects BB1 and 111   |
| 12   | ZDBPSEL0 | selects BP8.                                           |
|      |          |                                                        |
| 11   | ZDBPEN   | Causes ZD pin to mirror bitplane selected by ZDBPSELx  |
|      |          | bits. This does not disable the ZD mode defined by     |
|      |          | ZDCTEN, but rather is "ored" with it.                  |
| 10   | ZDCTEN   | Causes ZD pin to mirror bit #15 of the active entry in |
|      |          | high color table. When ZDCTEN is reset ZD reverts to   |
|      |          | mirroring color (0).                                   |
| 09   | KILLEHB  | Disables extra half brite mode.                        |
| 08   | RDRAM=0  | Causes color table address to read the color table     |
|      |          | instead of writing to it.                              |
| 07   | SOGEN=0  | When set causes SOG output pin to go high.             |
| 06   | PF2PRI   | Gives playfield 2 priority over playfield 1.           |
|      |          |                                                        |
| 05   | PF2P2    | Playfield 2 priority code (with resp. to sprites).     |
| 04   | PF2P1    |                                                        |
| 03   | PF2P0    |                                                        |
|      |          |                                                        |
| 02   | PF1P2    | Playfield 1 priority code (with resp. to sprites).     |
| 01   | PF1P1    |                                                        |
| 00   | PF1P0    |                                                        |
