These addresses each read a 16 bit register. These in turn
are loaded from the MDAT serial stream and are clocked in on
the rising edge of SCLK. MLD output is used to parallel load
the external parallel-to-serial converter. This in turn is
loaded with the 4 quadrature inputs from each of two game
controller ports (8 total) plus 8 miscellaneous control bits
which are new for LISA and can be read in upper 8 bits of
[LISAID](LISAID.md).
Register bits are as follows:
Mouse counter usage (pins 1,3 = Yclock, pins 2,4 = Xclock)

| BIT# | 15 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 11 | 10 | 09 | 08 | 07 | 06 | 05 | 04 | 03 | 02 | 01 | 00 |
|------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| [JOY0DAT](JOYxDAT.md) | Y7 | Y6 | Y5 | Y4 | Y3 | Y2 | Y1 | Y0 | X7 | X6 | X5 | X4 | X3 | X2 | X1 | X0 |

0=LEFT CONTROLLER PAIR, 1=RIGHT CONTROLLER PAIR.
(4 counters total). The bit usage for both left and right
addresses is shown below. Each 6 bit counter (Y7-Y2,X7-X2) is
clocked by 2 of the signals input from the mouse serial
stream. Starting with first bit received:


| Serial | Bit Name | Description                             |
|---|---|---|
|   0    | M0H      | [JOY0DAT](JOYxDAT.md) Horizontal Clock                |
|   1    | M0HQ     | [JOY0DAT](JOYxDAT.md) Horizontal Clock (quadrature)   |
|   2    | M0V      | [JOY0DAT](JOYxDAT.md) Vertical Clock                  |
|   3    | M0VQ     | [JOY0DAT](JOYxDAT.md) Vertical Clock  (quadrature)    |
|   4    | M1V      | [JOY1DAT](JOYxDAT.md) Horizontal Clock                |
|   5    | M1VQ     | [JOY1DAT](JOYxDAT.md) Horizontal Clock (quadrature)   |
|   6    | M1V      | [JOY1DAT](JOYxDAT.md) Vertical Clock                  |
|   7    | M1VQ     | [JOY1DAT](JOYxDAT.md) Vertical Clock (quadrature)     |


Bits 1 and 0 of each counter (Y1-Y0,X1-X0) may be
read to determine the state of the related input signal pair.
This allows these pins to double as joystick switch inputs.
Joystick switch closures can be deciphered as follows:


| Directions | Pin# | Counter bits                    |
|---|---|---|
| Forward    |  1   | Y1 xor Y0 (BIT#09 xor BIT#08)   |
| Left       |  3   | Y1                              |
| Back       |  2   | X1 xor X0 (BIT#01 xor BIT#00)   |
| Right      |  4   | X1                              |or BIT#00)   |
| Right      |  4   | X1                              |
