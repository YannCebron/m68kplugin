# ASL, ASR - Arithmetic shift left/right

## Operation
[destination] ← [destination] shifted by \<count\>

## Syntax
```assembly
ASL Dx,Dy
ASR Dx,Dy
ASL #<data>,Dy
ASR #<data>,Dy
ASL <ea>
ASR <ea>
```

## Attributes
`Size` byte, word, longword

## Description
Arithmetically shift the bits of the operand in the specified direction 
(i.e., left or right). The shift count may be specified in one of
three ways. The count may be a literal, the contents of a data
register, or the value 1. An immediate (i.e., literal) count permits
a shift of 1 to 8 places. If the count is in a register, the value is
modulo 64 (i.e., 0 to 63). If no count is specified, one shift is made
(i.e., `ASL \<ea\>` shifts the contents of the word at the effective
address one place left).
The effect of an arithmetic shift left is to shift a zero into the
least-significant bit position and to shift the most-significant bit
out into both the X- and the C-bits of the *CCR*. The overflow bit
of the *CCR* is set if a sign change occurs during shifting (i.e., if
the most-significant bit changes value during shifting).
The effect of an arithmetic shift right is to shift the least-significant bit into both the X- and C-bits of the CCR. The most-significant bit (i.e., the sign bit) is replicated to preserve the sign of
the number.

## Application
ASL multiplies a twoís complement number by 2. ASL is almost
identical to the corresponding logical shift, LSR. The only difference between ASL and LSL is that ASL sets the V-bit of the CCR if
overflow occurs, while LSL clears the V-bit to zero. An ASR divides
a twoís complement number by 2. When applied to the contents
of a memory location, all 68000 shift operations operate on a word.

## Condition codes
|X|N|Z|V|C|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|*|*|*|*|*|

The X-bit and the C-bit are set according to the last bit shifted out
of the operand. If the shift count is zero, the C-bit is cleared. The
V-bit is set if the most-significant bit is changed at any time
during the shift operation and cleared otherwise.
