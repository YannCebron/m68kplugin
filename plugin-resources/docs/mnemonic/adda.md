# ADDA - Add address


## Operation
[destination] ← [source] + [destination]

## Syntax
```assembly
ADDA <ea>,An
```

## Attributes
`Size` word, longword

## Description
Add the source operand to the destination address register and
store the result in the destination address register. The source is
sign-extended before it is added to the destination. For example,
if we execute `ADDA.W D3,A4` where A4 = 00000100<sub>16</sub> and
D3.W = 800216 , the contents of D3 are sign-extended to FFFF8002<sub>16</sub> and
added to 00000100<sub>16</sub> to give FFFF8102<sub>16</sub> , which is stored in A4.


## Application
To add to the contents of an address register and not update the
CCR. Note that `ADDA.W D0,A0` is the same as `LEA (A0,D0.W),A0`.

## Condition codes
|X|N|Z|V|C|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|-|-|-|-|-|
An `ADDA` operation does not affect the state of the CCR.
