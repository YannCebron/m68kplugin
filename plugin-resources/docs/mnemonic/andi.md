# ANDI - AND immediate

## Operation
[destination] ← \<literal\>.[destination]

## Syntax
```assembly
ANDI #<data>,<ea>
```

## Attributes
`Size` byte, word, longword

## Description
*AND* the immediate data to the destination operand. The `ANDI`
permits a literal operand to be ANDed with a destination other
than a data register. For example, `ANDI #$FE00,$1234` or
`ANDI.B #$F0,(A2)+`.

## Application
`AND` is used to mask bits. If we wish to clear bits 3 to 6 of data
register *D7*, we can execute `AND #%10000111,D7`. Unfortunately,
the `AND` operation cannot be used with an address register as
either a source or a destination operand. If you wish to perform a
logical operation on an address register, you have to copy the
address to a data register and then perform the operation there.

## Condition codes

# ANDI to CCR - AND immediate to condition

## code register

## Operation
[CCR] ← <data>.[CCR]

## Syntax
`ANDI #<data>,CCR`

## Attributes
`Size` byte

## Description
*AND* the immediate data to the condition code register (i.e., the
least-significant byte of the status register).

## Application
`ANDI` is used to clear selected bits of the `CCR`. For example,
`ANDI #$FA,CCR` clears the Z- and C-bits, i.e., XNZVC = X N 0 V 0.

## Condition codes
|X|N|Z|V|C|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|*|*|*|*|*|

- X: cleared if bit 4 of data is zero
- N: cleared if bit 3 of data is zero
- Z: cleared if bit 2 of data is zero
- V: cleared if bit 1 of data is zero
- C: cleared if bit 0 of data is zero

# ANDI to SR - AND immediate to status register

## Operation
```
IF [S] = 1
  THEN
    [SR] ← <literal>.[SR]
  ELSE TRAP
```

## Syntax
`ANDI #<data>,SR`

## Attributes
`Size` word

## Description
*AND* the immediate data to the status register and store the
result in the status register. All bits of the SR are affected.

## Application
This instruction is used to clear the interrupt mask, the S-bit, and
the T-bit of the *SR*. `ANDI #<data>,SR` affects both the status byte
of the *SR* and the *CCR*. For example, `ANDI #$7FFF,SR` clears the
trace bit of the status register, while `ANDI #$7FFE,SR` clears the
trace bit and also clears the carry bit of the *CCR*.
